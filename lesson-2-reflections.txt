What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The folder becomes a git repository. This is necesssary if you want to use git to track
edits in files held in that folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area exists between the working directory and the repository and acts as 
an inbetween stage between the two. It contains files that have been worked on in the 
working directory and then flagged to be added to the repository.
It allows the user to develop a full picture of what will be added to the repository in
the next commit.
