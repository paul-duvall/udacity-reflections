What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The folder becomes a git repository. This is necesssary if you want to use git to track
edits in files held in that folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area exists between the working directory and the repository and acts as 
an inbetween stage between the two. It contains files that have been worked on in the 
working directory and then flagged to be added to the repository.
It allows the user to develop a full picture of what will be added to the repository in
the next commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By using the staging area, it isn't necessary to include every file that has been changed in
the same commit. Add the files to the staging area that are relevant to the current
commit, leaving out any files that have been changed but are not relevant to the change
that the current commit focuses on.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branching can help in situations where you want to make changes to the respository but
you want to retain an original version that will not show these changes. For example, if you
want to try out a new experimental feature, you can create a new branch to build and experiment
with that feature without affect the original version (which could continue with other changes
and commits unrelated to the new feature you are experimenting on in the new branch).
