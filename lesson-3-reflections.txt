When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

This would be necessary whenever you want your repository to be available to others. Repositories can be made publich on Github so that 
anyone can view them or potentially contribute, or private so that they can be shared with a specific group of people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Not too sure! Perhaps if the remote repository were being worked upon by other people, you wouldn't want those changes integrated into
your local repository necessarily.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A branch is a part of a repository that operates independently of the rest. It can contain any number of commits and can
be merged with other branches at any time. A clone is a copy of a repository that operates independently of the original.
A fork is also a copy of a repository but it retains a connection to the original (it is marked as a fork of the orignal, and the
original tracks how many forks have been made.
